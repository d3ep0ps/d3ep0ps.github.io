# “Why I Write: From Commands to Cloud and AI”
## A calm, practical journey from the terminal prompt to intelligent infrastructure.

Ця стаття — про мету створення d3ep0ps: допомагати людям зрозуміти системи — від Linux і FreeBSD до хмарних технологій та штучного інтелекту. Англомовна версія нижче.

When I started working with systems, everything began in the terminal — configuring network interfaces, fixing DNS, rebuilding kernels. It was quiet, direct, and deeply satisfying.

Over the years, I have watched the world change: from virtualization and containers to the rise of the cloud and now AI, transforming how systems operate. But the fundamentals — understanding how things actually work — remain the same.

This is why I created d3ep0ps:

> A calm, noise-free space for individuals who want to understand technology deeply, not just use it.

## Who I Am

My name is Vitaliy Zhhuta — a System & Solution Architect by profession and a physicist by education.

I’ve spent years working across the full stack of technology:

* Linux and FreeBSD systems
* Networking and IPv4/IPv6
* Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code
* Cloud architectures on Google Cloud Platform
* Automation and AI/ML integrations

I like building systems that make sense — from packets on the wire to machine-learning models in the cloud.

## Why I Write

Because every engineer starts somewhere. Some in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, others in the Cloud Console, and some fine-tuning models in a Jupyter notebook. But they all benefit from clarity and structure — understanding one layer at a time.

The internet is full of fragments — isolated tutorials, hype posts, or shallow AI demos. Here, I want to build a continuous journey: from the basics of self-hosting to the intelligence of modern systems.

## What D3ep0Ps Covers

Think of it as a roadmap:

* **Foundation:** Linux / FreeBSD administration, shell discipline, and security habits
* **Networking:** IPv4/IPv6, VLANs, routers, DNS, VPNs/WireGuard, monitoring
* **Self-Hosting:** Mail, reverse proxies, and automation for small services
* **Cloud:** Deploying and managing workloads on GCP, Kubernetes, and hybrid setups
* **Automation:** Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD, observability, and agents
* **AI & ML:** Connecting everything you learned to build intelligent systems that adapt and optimize

Each article adds one more block — practical, tested, and explained in plain language.

## What You’ll Learn Here

* The why behind every command, not just copy-paste snippets
* How to build confidence through experimentation
* How to think like an architect, even when working alone
* How the same principles scale from a Raspberry Pi to a global cloud platform
* How AI fits naturally into modern infrastructure (not replaces it)

## My Promise

This will always be a space for real engineers and curious learners. No hype, no “10 ways to get rich with AI” — just understanding, iteration, and continuous growth.

## What Comes Next

We’ll start from the ground up:

> “Choosing Your OS: Linux vs FreeBSD — Foundations That Shape How You Think”

Then move toward OS configuration, networking, self-hosting, and eventually cloud automation and AI. Step by step — so that by the time we reach the cloud, you’ll understand every layer beneath it.

Join me on this journey — from the command line to intelligent systems.
